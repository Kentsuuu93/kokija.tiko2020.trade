  Our company organizes travels that are fulfilling 100% of your needs and
  exceptions. If you wish to learn to know about Chinese, Korean or Japanese tea
  culture, we can plan a tour where you are going to learn all the aspects about
  tea, how it grows, how it is produced and how it is sold. You will also learn
  how the tea should be served and what you are supposed to eat and do while
  enjoying your tea.
</p>
<p>
  If you are more interested about handicrafts in East Asia, we will take you to
  see for example Japanese carpenters. Or if you rather know more about Chinese
  medicine or learn about Japanese bathing culture, well, look no further. We
  will arrange you a trip where you will learn about those.
</p>
<p>
  All our guides speak perfect English and the local language of your
  destination. They will act as your guides and translators. They are perfectly
  capable to handle also all the emergency situations and can help you in case
  you need to see a doctor.
</p>
<p>
  Accommodation is organized according to your wishes. Flights and other travel
  will also be arranged as you wish. If you wish to have luxury, that is what
  you will get. If you would rather experience simple life, then that is what
  you get.
</p>
<p>
  Our priority is to provide you exiting experiences safely. Thus, it might
  happen that in some occasions our guide will suggest some other solution to
  your wishes. For example, if you wish to learn to know street food in East
  Asia, we might occasionally suggest you a different location, just to be safe
  that you will complete your travel in good health.

<h2 id="kurssisection" class="center">Courses and Seminars</h2>

<h3>Seminars related to your travel:</h3>
<p>
  If you so wish, we can arrange lectures of the topic of your interest before
  your trip. In these lectures we go through some of the aspects of the topic
  you wish to learn and thus ensure that you will have the most memorable
  experiences when you go to see them. It is always exponentially more
  interesting to see something that you have just learned in your own eyes.
</p>

<h3>Other courses and seminars:</h3>
<p>
  We organize regularly short courses and seminars about various topics on East
  Asia.
