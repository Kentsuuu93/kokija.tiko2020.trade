    Xiangyunsha silk, which could be turned into a fabric of fragrant clouds, is
    produced in Foshan City, Guangdong Province. Silk is produced by traditional
    methods. It is dyed using iron-rich mud and vegetable dyes. Dyed fabrics are
    easily dried in the south and whose colors are subtly earthy. The patterning
    is only on one side of the fabric, the other side of the fabric is
    monochrome. Silk is inherently antibacterial and feels very comfortable
    against the skin. On the skin, silk feels cool in hot weather and warm in
    cold weather.
